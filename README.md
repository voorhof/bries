This is a basic starter kit for Laravel authentication scaffolding using [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) as the frontend toolkit.  
Heavily inspired on the breeze and blade package option from [Laravel Breeze](https://github.com/laravel/breeze).

## Installation

This package should only be used within a fresh Laravel installation.  
You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require voorhof/bries --dev
```

Run this command to set up the starter kit,  
it will copy all necessary resource files to your app and update existing ones:

```bash
php artisan bries:install
```

When you choose to include the CSS grid or dark mode, it will set a root variable.   
This can always be updated after installation inside the bootstrap.scss file:

```scss
$enable-cssgrid: false;
$enable-dark-mode: false;
```

For using the dark mode and switching themes, you can implement a theme toggler of your choice.  
An example of a theme switch toggler can be found on the cheatsheet page, including its styles and scripts.
